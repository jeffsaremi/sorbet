# for now we'll just lean on QEMU via Docker BuildX to create multi-arch
# images, since we don't have arm64 rigs in the CI farm (er... rather, GitHub
# doesn't, and we don't have custom in-house runners) to build on.
#
# one day, whether it's on GH Actions or a custom CI system, the ideal (read:
# often 3-6x faster for crunch-heavy loads like compiling C++ stuff, like
# Watchman) world would be to build images on their native arch, push to an
# intermediate tag, then combine them into a manifest manually with a process
# like
